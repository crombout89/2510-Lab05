/* Task 4: To define a program which holds an integer array, called data, with initial values as {11, 12, 13},
with a pointer points to data[0]; use the pointer to updates data[1] to 60, and print data[1] using the pointer.
[Hint: itâ€™s your choice whether move the pointer or not, either way works] */
